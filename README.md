## Skills Utilized

1. **Conditional Statements**: The program uses `if-elif-else` statements to determine the winner based on the player's choice and the computer's choice.
2. **Random Number Generation**: The `randint` function from the `random` module is used to generate a random choice for the computer.
3. **Switch/Match Operator**: A game state is determined by using the `match case` statement to check the `case` and to determine an outcome.
4. **String Manipulation**: The program manipulates strings to display the player's and computer's choices in the game results.
5. **User Input**: The program utilizes the `input` function to get the player's choice and ask for restarting the game.
6. **Looping**: The game is wrapped in a `while` loop to allow the player to restart and play multiple rounds.
